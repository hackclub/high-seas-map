# High Seas Map

A map for ships on Hack Club's High Seas!

Every ship submitted to High Seas and in the YSWS DB is plotted on this interactive map according to the languages used in the GitHub repository.

This is done through a series of steps coded in a Python API using igraph and dumped to local files, which are then served to the client, which uses React and Sigma.js to render the ships on the map!

Visit the map to see where your ship sailed to on the High Seas!
